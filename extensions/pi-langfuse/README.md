Langfuse observability extension for [Pi Coding Agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent). Sends complete Pi agent runs to [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) so you can inspect the user prompt, root agent workflow, every LLM generation, every tool call, final assistant response, usage, cost, and health scores in one trace.

## Why Langfuse?

Langfuse provides open-source observability for LLM applications. This extension allows you to **trace**, **monitor**, and **debug** your Pi sessions with production-grade detail, helping you understand exactly how your agent is performing, what it's costing you, and where it might be failing.

## Features

- **Complete Agent Traces**: Creates one trace per user prompt with a root `agent` observation containing the prompt input and final assistant output.
- **REST fallback for self-hosted Langfuse**: Uses the Langfuse OpenTelemetry SDK first, then verifies that the trace is visible. If a self-hosted OTel ingestion pipeline accepts spans but does not materialize traces, the extension writes the run through Langfuse's REST ingestion API.
- **Per-Request Generations**: Records a separate `generation` observation for every provider request, including the actual provider payload instead of only the original prompt.
- **Final Message Capture**: Uses finalized assistant messages for generation and root outputs, so Langfuse shows what the user actually saw in Pi.
- **Tool Observability**: Creates Langfuse `tool` observations for every tool call, including arguments, results, error states, and payload/latency metrics.
- **Parallel Tool Safety**: Correlates tool observations by `toolCallId`, avoiding result mix-ups when Pi runs tools concurrently.
- **Session Correlation**: Groups traces from the same Pi session under a shared Langfuse session ID.
- **Cost and Token Tracking**: Records usage and cost details on each generation when Pi/provider payloads expose them.
- **Evaluation Scores**: Automatically computes and sends tool success rates, error counts, and session health metrics.
- **Defensive Payload Shaping**: Parses JSON-like strings when possible, limits object depth, and truncates large payloads before upload.

## Highlights

`pi-langfuse` is designed to make a Pi run readable as an agent workflow, not just a bag of logs:

- The trace input/output mirrors the root `agent` observation, making the run understandable from the Langfuse trace list and detail view.
- The first generation in a tool-using run can show the assistant's tool-call message, the tool observation shows execution I/O, and the follow-up generation shows the final natural-language answer.
- Tool failures are marked on the tool observation and reflected in trace-level scores, while later generations still preserve the tool error result in their input history.
- Shutdown and interrupted runs flush pending telemetry and mark unfinished observations as cancelled/warning instead of silently losing the trace.
- Agent-end runtime shutdown is deferred so Langfuse flushing does not block Pi's visible turn completion.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 22
- **Pi Coding Agent** installed and configured
- A **Langfuse** account ([cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) or self-hosted)

## Installation

### Option 1: Install via npm (recommended for users)

```bash
pi install npm:pi-langfuse
```

Pi will download the package and register it as an extension.

### Option 2: Install from local source (recommended for development)

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pi-langfuse
npm install
```

Then tell Pi to use it:

```bash
pi link /path/to/pi-langfuse
```

Or run Pi from the project directory — Pi auto-discovers extensions in the current directory's `package.json`.

## Configuration

You need Langfuse API keys. Get them from **Langfuse Cloud** → **Settings** → **API Keys**.

There are three ways to configure the extension:

### Method 1: Interactive setup (easiest)

Run any `pi` command with the extension loaded. On first run without configuration, Pi will prompt you in the CLI or TUI for:

1. **Langfuse public key** — starts with `pk-lf-...`
2. **Langfuse secret key** — starts with `sk-lf-...`
3. **Langfuse host** — defaults to `https://cloud.langfuse.com`

The extension saves these to `~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse/config.json`, so package updates and reinstalls do not overwrite your Langfuse credentials.

To re-run setup at any time:

```
/langfuse-setup
```

### Method 2: Environment variables (fallback)

Set these before starting Pi:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-xxxx"
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-xxxx"
export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="https://cloud.langfuse.com"  # optional; LANGFUSE_HOST is also supported
```

The saved config file takes precedence. Environment variables are used only when `~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse/config.json` does not exist or is incomplete, which avoids drift after re-running `/langfuse-setup`.

### Method 3: Persistent config.json

For persistent local configuration, create or update `~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse/config.json`:

```json
{
  "publicKey": "pk-lf-xxxx",
  "secretKey": "sk-lf-xxxx",
  "host": "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
}
```

> **⚠️ Security**: Keep `~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse/config.json` private. Never commit API keys to version control.

## Usage

### Basic usage

Run Pi as usual — the extension auto-loads and traces every agent run:

```bash
pi "Explain the architecture of Redis"
```

After the session ends, check your [Langfuse dashboard](https://cloud.langfuse.com) for the trace.

### Verify the extension is loaded

```bash
pi list
```

You should see `pi-langfuse` in the list of installed packages.

### Multiple sessions

Each Pi session gets its own Langfuse session ID. Each user prompt within that Pi session becomes a separate Langfuse trace grouped under the same session.

## Development Setup

If you're contributing to this extension:

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pi-langfuse
npm install

# Type-check your changes
npm run typecheck

# Test with Pi
pi "test prompt"
```

### Validation

There is no dedicated test suite yet. To validate changes:

1. Run `npm run typecheck` for TypeScript errors
2. Start Pi with the extension enabled
3. Run a few prompts
4. Confirm traces, the root agent observation, tool observations, generations, and evaluation scores appear in your Langfuse project

## Langfuse Dashboard

After running, check your Langfuse project for:

1. **Traces** — All pi agent runs with I/O
2. **Sessions** — Traces grouped by session ID
3. **Observations** — Tool calls and LLM generations
4. **Scores** — Evaluation metrics (tool errors, success rate, etc.)
5. **Model Usage** — Usage breakdown by model

You can also monitor your Langfuse data directly from the terminal using the built-in Langfuse skill:

```
/pi-langfuse-langfuse <your-query>
```

## Troubleshooting

### No traces appearing?
- Verify API keys are correct — run `/langfuse-setup` to re-configure
- Check your Langfuse project is active and has write capacity
- Ensure API keys have write permissions (not read-only)
- Look for `📊 Langfuse:` log messages in the Pi output

### Extension not loading?
```bash
pi list                      # Verify pi-langfuse is installed
pi install npm:pi-langfuse   # Reinstall if missing
```

### "Missing config" message on startup?
- The extension needs credentials. Use the interactive `/langfuse-setup` command
- Or set `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` environment variables

### Model/cost not showing?
- Not all providers expose cost information
- Check the Langfuse traces API for raw observation data
- The `model` field in generations comes from provider events, finalized assistant messages, `model_select`, or `ctx.model`

### API key errors?
- Langfuse public keys start with `pk-lf-`, secret keys with `sk-lf-`
- If self-hosting, verify your host URL is correct
